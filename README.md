# 3020 Assignments Repository
* READ THIS IF TOTALLY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH BASIC GIT FUNCTIONS, otherwise skip ahead to group protocol suggestions
* Since we've agreed on VS, this will be oriented for that context
- To work with the github repo in VS, you must first clone it. (Git > Clone Repository > use ...github.com/mattjhellard/3020Assignments), this will create a local copy of the repo
- To import changes made to the github repo since cloning, you can pull (in Git Changes tab on RHS)
- To make changes to the github repo from VS, you should sign into your github account within VS (File > Account Settings > All Accounts > Add)
- When signed in, you can update the github repo by commiting changes and then pushing them. (in Git Changes tab on RHS)
- For major and/or experimental changes, you can create a new branch to push changes without worrying about effecting the main (aka master) branch. (Git Changes > branch selection dropdown > New Branch)
- Branches can be merged back into one branch
## Suggested git group protocols:
1. Make sure to pull before making changes, pay attention to pulled changes
2. Before doing something, check for comments declaring developments in that area
3. Before doing something major like developing an entire method, push a comment describing what you plan to change in the vicinity of where the changes will occur before making those changes
4. Consider creating branches for major developments, merging when done
